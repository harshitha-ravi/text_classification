# Text classification for Prodcut Review Data

This is my final project in Data Mining. I've picked text classification as my final project.

To run this code in your local environment, first download the Notebook from my kaggle link or you can also refer to the code
in my git profile.

Kaggle Notebook link :

Download the Dataset from the below link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivekgediya/ecommerce-product-review-data?select=Flipkart_Reviews+-+Electronics.csv

Place the dataset in the same folder as the downloaded jupter notebook. And you're all set to run the code now.

That's it! It's just a simple set up.
